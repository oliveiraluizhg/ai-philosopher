    "content": "Look, if you hated the taste, if it didn’t feel good, if you weren’t getting good results, if it didn’t guarantee a dopamine hit, it wouldn’t exactly require much discipline to steer clear. That’s the whole point of the virtue isn’t it? That it’s requiring you to resist an impulse or forgo a pleasure? As we said recently, discipline is about doing what’s hard. Just as courage is the triumph over fear, discipline is the triumph over another lower part of our nature. A lot of times discipline is pushing yourself to do something you don’t want to do, but the other part of it—what we might call the temperance part—is not doing the stuff you do want to do. In some ways, this takes the most strength (more on this in Discipline Is Destiny). Seneca said we’re all slaves to one thing or another—sex or ambition, attention or chaos. By indulging in these passions often enough, eventually we lose the freedom to abstain from them. We just can’t not. We need discipline to push through that. To resist the urge to keep going when it’s not serving us. To step back when our ambition tempts us to overreach. To recognize that rest, recovery, and restraint are not signs of weakness but also of strength and wisdom. True discipline means knowing when to stop. It’s having the courage to say no—to the extra hour, the extra project, the unsustainable pace—so that we can sustain ourselves for the long haul. Discipline, in this way, isn’t just about action; it’s about control. Control over our impulses, our desires, and even our most deeply ingrained habits. Without it, we are slaves. Only through temperance can we ever be truly free."

    "content": "It’d be nice to be head honcho. It would be cool to be the owner. It’d be nice to look out over a vast bit of territory and say, “This is all mine.” This is the fantasy, this is the ambition that drives so many of us, that drove so many in the ancient world too. But as the Stoics noted, when we pursue power, control, or money, we end up neglecting what’s right in front of us. Epictetus, who was a slave, looked around at Nero’s court and saw rich and famous men who were less free than he was. Because they spent all their energy trying to get more than what they had, because their happiness was tied up in what other people thought, because their fears were based on things that were not up to them. In The Girl Who Would Be Free (our fable based on the life of Epictetus), Epictetus’ father says that to be great, we first have to focus on “the empire between our ears.” He’s referring to our thoughts, our emotions, our urges, our desires, our fears…our own choices. You have to understand that if we can rule this, then we are the head honcho, then we are the owner, then we do control an immense territory. We’re more powerful than many emperors, conquerors and billionaires. We’re as free as it’s possible to be."

    "title": "Start The Clock. Just Start The Clock",
    "content": "We don’t like how long they’re taking to get back to us. It’s slowing down the process, keeping us from doing what we want to do. We don’t like the estimate from the vendor who just told us it will be an extra six weeks over the initial projections. We’re frustrated the investment advisor told us we won’t hit our goal until later than expected. And there’s no question, this is annoying. It may well be fixable–if they could get their act together. But we don’t control that or them. ​You know what we did control though? We controlled how long it took us to reach out to get that bid. We controlled how long that thing was on our to-do list, and the fact that we waited until now to get around to doing it. We’re the ones who hemmed and hawed about the decision that we’re now rushing. A Stoic understands that they don’t control how long it takes other people to do things. Still, they don’t see themselves as powerless. No, they embrace the power they have–namely when they start the clock. Things take time, so why add time by being indecisive? By procrastinating? By sitting on things? You don’t yell at paint for drying slowly, urging it to hurry up because you have guests coming over. You finish painting with enough time for it to do what it’s going to do. So it goes for life and other people. We can’t rush them along, but we can make sure we’re not unnecessarily tarrying, not adding to the clock on our end. Accept that others are slow. If you need things to go faster, speed up on your end."

    "content": "How would you describe someone who lies to you? Who riles you up? Who makes you anxious and afraid? Who questions whether you’re good enough? Who has preposterous blindspots and disturbing biases? Who prods you to suspect the worst of others? Who tricks you into doing things you’ll regret? Who encourages your worst impulses? But this is what our mind does to us on a daily basis! Your mind is not your friend, The National sings. “It takes you by the hand / And leaves you nowhere.” They’re not wrong. As much faith as the Stoics had in our “ruling reason,” they were also quite skeptical, even suspicious, of our mind. That’s why Epictetus talked about putting every impression to the test. That’s what Marcus Aurelius was doing in his Meditations, working through his thoughts, having a kind of debate with himself about things he was sometimes inclined to think but knew might be wrong. And this is the work that we must do. Our mind can be a partner and a friend, sure. But we have to be of two minds about it. Our mind can be a source of strength and support. But it is also not the most reliable or trustworthy of friends. We have to understand, accommodate and adapt to this reality, make our decisions, and think our thoughts accordingly."
